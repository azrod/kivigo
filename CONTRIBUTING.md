## ðŸš€ Creating Releases

For maintainers: KiviGo uses an automated release workflow that creates tags for both the main library and all backend modules.

### Using the Release Workflow

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in the GitHub repository
2. Select the **Release** workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Enter the version (e.g., `v1.5.0`) following semantic versioning
5. Choose whether to create a GitHub release (recommended: `true`)

The workflow will automatically:
- Create a main project tag (e.g., `v1.5.0`)
- Create backend-specific tags (e.g., `backend/consul/v1.5.0`, `backend/redis/v1.5.0`)
- Generate a GitHub release with usage instructions

### Manual Tagging (Alternative)

If needed, you can create tags manually:

```sh
# Main project
git tag v1.5.0

# Backend modules (repeat for each backend)
git tag backend/consul/v1.5.0
git tag backend/redis/v1.5.0
# ... etc

# Push all tags
git push origin --tags
```
